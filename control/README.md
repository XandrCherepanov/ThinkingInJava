# Controlling Execution

**Exercise 1: (1)** Write a program that prints values from 1 to 100.
**Answer: [OneHundred.java](src/main/java/OneHundred.java)**

**Exercise 2: (2)** Write a program that generates 25 random **int** values. 
For each value, use an **if-else** statement to classify it as greater than, 
less than, or equal to a second randomly generated value.
**Answer: [IfElseRandom.java](src/main/java/IfElseRandom.java)**

**Exercise 3: (1)** Modify Exercise 2 so that your code is surrounded 
by an “infinite” **while** loop. It will then run until you interrupt 
it from the keyboard (typically by pressing Control-C).

**Exercise 4: (3)** Write a program that uses two nested **for** loops 
and the modulus operator (**%**) to detect and print prime numbers 
(integral numbers that are not evenly divisible by any other numbers 
except for themselves and 1).

**Exercise 5: (4)** Repeat Exercise 10 from the previous chapter, 
using the ternary operator and a bitwise test to display the ones 
and zeroes, instead of **Integer.toBinaryString()**.
