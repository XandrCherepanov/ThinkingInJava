# Inner Classes

**Exercise 1: (1)** Write a class named **Outer** that contains an inner class named **Inner**. 
Add a method to **Outer** that returns an object of type **Inner**. 
In **main()**, create and initialize a reference to an **Inner**.
**Answer: [Outer.java](src/main/java/Outer.java)**

**Exercise 2: (1)** Create a class that holds a **String**, and has a **toString()** method that displays this **String**.
Add several instances of your new class to a **Sequence** object, then display them.
**Answer: [Sequence.java](src/main/java/Sequence.java)**

**Exercise 3: (1)** Modify Exercise 1 so that **Outer** has a **private String** field (initialized by the constructor), 
and **Inner** has a **toString()** that displays this field.
Create an object of type **Inner** and display it.
**Answer: [Outer2.java](src/main/java/Outer2.java)**
