# Everything is an Object

**Exercise 1: (2)** Create a class containing an **int** and a **char** that are not initialized,
and print their values to verify that Java performs default initialization. **Answer: InitializationTest.java**

**Exercise 2: (1)** Following the **HelloDate.java** example in this chapter,
create a “hello, world” program that simply displays that statement.
You need only a single method in your class (the “main” one that gets executed when the program starts).
Remember to make it **static** and to include the argument list, even though you don’t use the argument list.
Compile the program with **javac** and run it using **java**.
If you are using a different development environment than the JDK,
learn how to compile and run programs in that environment. **Answer: HelloWorld.java**

**Exercise 3: (1)** Find the code fragments involving ATypeName and turn them into a program that compiles and runs.
**Answer: ATypeNameTest.java**

Exercise 4: (1) Turn the DataOnly code fragments into a program that compiles and runs.

Exercise 5: (1) Modify the previous exercise so that the values of the data in DataOnly are assigned to and printed in main( ).

Exercise 6: (2) Write a program that includes and calls the storage( ) method defined as a code fragment in this chapter.

Exercise 7: (1) Turn the Incrementable code fragments into a working program.

Exercise 8: (3) Write a program that demonstrates that, no matter how many objects you create of a particular class,
there is only one instance of a particular static field in that class.

Exercise 9: (2) Write a program that demonstrates that autoboxing works for all the primitive types and their wrappers.

Exercise 10: (2) Write a program that prints three arguments taken from the command line.
To do this, you’ll need to index into the command-line array of Strings.

Exercise 11: (1) Turn the AllTheColorsOfTheRainbow example into a program that compiles and runs.

Exercise 12: (2) Find the code for the second version of HelloDate.java,
which is the simple comment documentation example.
Execute Javadoc on the file and view the results with your Web browser.

Exercise 13: (1) Run Documentation1.java, Documentation2.java, and Documentation3.java through Javadoc.
Verify the resulting documentation with your Web browser.

Exercise 14: (1) Add an HTML list of items to the documentation in the previous exercise.

Exercise 15: (1) Take the program in Exercise 2 and add comment documentation to it.
Extract this comment documentation into an HTML file using Javadoc and view it with your Web browser.

Exercise 16: (1) In the Initialization & Cleanup chapter, locate the Overloading.java example
and add Javadoc documentation. Extract this comment documentation into an HTML file using Javadoc
and view it with your Web browser.
