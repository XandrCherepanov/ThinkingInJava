# Operators

**Exercise 1: (1)** Write a program that uses the "short" and normal form of print statement.
**Answer: [ShortPrintTest.java](src/main/java/ShortPrintTest.java)**

**Exercise 2: (1)** Create a class containing a **float** and use it to demonstrate aliasing.
**Answer: [Aliasing.java](src/main/java/Aliasing.java)**

**Exercise 3: (1)** Create a class containing a **float**
and use it to demonstrate aliasing during method calls.
**Answer: [AliasingMethod.java](src/main/java/AliasingMethod.java)**

**Exercise 4: (2)** Write a program that calculates velocity
using a constant distance and a constant time.
**Answer: [Velocity.java](src/main/java/Velocity.java)**

**Exercise 5: (2)** Create a class called **Dog** containing two **String**s: **name** and **says**.
In **main( )**, create two dog objects with names “spot” (who says, “Ruff!”) and “scruffy” (who says, “Wurf!”).
Then display their names and what they say.
**Answer: [Dog.java](src/main/java/Dog.java), [DogTest.java](src/main/java/DogTest.java)**

**Exercise 6: (3)** Following Exercise 5, create a new **Dog** reference
and assign it to spot’s object. Test for comparison
using **==** and **equals( )** for all references.
**Answer: [Dog.java](src/main/java/Dog.java), [DogsComparison.java](src/main/java/DogsComparison.java)**

**Exercise 7: (3)** Write a program that simulates coin-flipping.
**Answer: [CoinFlipping.java](src/main/java/CoinFlipping.java)**

**Exercise 8: (2)** Show that hex and octal notations work with long values.
Use **Long.toBinaryString()** to display the results.
**Answer: [LongNotations.java](src/main/java/LongNotations.java)**

**Exercise 9: (1)** Display the largest and smallest numbers for both **float** and
**double** exponential notation.
**Answer: [ExponentialNotation.java](src/main/java/ExponentialNotation.java)**

**Exercise 10: (3)** Write a program with two constant values, one with 
alternating binary ones and zeroes, with a zero in the least-significant 
digit, and the second, also alternating, with a one in the least-significant digit 
(hint: It’s easiest to use hexadecimal constants for this). 
Take these two values and combine them in all possible ways using 
the bitwise operators, and display the results using **Integer.toBinaryString()**.
**Answer: [BitwiseOperators.java](src/main/java/BitwiseOperators.java)**

**Exercise 11: (3)** Start with a number that has a binary one in the 
most significant position (hint: Use a hexadecimal constant). Using 
the signed right-shift operator, right shift it all the way through 
all of its binary positions, each time displaying the result using 
**Integer.toBinaryString()**.
**Answer: [RightShift.java](src/main/java/RightShift.java)**

**Exercise 12: (3)** Start with a number that is all binary ones. 
Left shift it, then use the unsigned right-shift operator to right 
shift through all of its binary positions, each time displaying the 
result using **Integer.toBinaryString()**.
**Answer: [UnsignedRightShift.java](src/main/java/UnsignedRightShift.java)**

**Exercise 13: (1)** Write a method that displays **char** values 
in binary form. Demonstrate it using several different characters.
**Answer: [CharBinary.java](src/main/java/CharBinary.java)**
