**Exercise 1: (1)** Write a program that uses the "short" and normal form of print statement.
**Answer: [ShortPrintTest.java](src/main/java/ShortPrintTest.java)**

**Exercise 2: (1)** Create a class containing a **float** and use it to demonstrate aliasing.
**Answer: [Aliasing.java](src/main/java/Aliasing.java)**

**Exercise 3: (1)** Create a class containing a **float**
and use it to demonstrate aliasing during method calls.
**Answer: [AliasingMethod.java](src/main/java/AliasingMethod.java)**

**Exercise 4: (2)** Write a program that calculates velocity
using a constant distance and a constant time.
**Answer: [Velocity.java](src/main/java/Velocity.java)**

**Exercise 5: (2)** Create a class called **Dog** containing two **String**s: **name** and **says**.
In **main( )**, create two dog objects with names “spot” (who says, “Ruff!”) and “scruffy” (who says, “Wurf!”).
Then display their names and what they say.
**Answer: [Dog.java](src/main/java/Dog.java), [DogTest.java](src/main/java/DogTest.java)**

**Exercise 6: (3)** Following Exercise 5, create a new **Dog** reference
and assign it to spot’s object. Test for comparison
using **==** and **equals( )** for all references.
**Answer: [Dog.java](src/main/java/Dog.java), [DogsComparison.java](src/main/java/DogsComparison.java)**

**Exercise 7: (3)** Write a program that simulates coin-flipping.
**Answer: [CoinFlipping.java](src/main/java/CoinFlipping.java)**

**Exercise 8: (2)** Show that hex and octal notations work with long values.
Use **Long.toBinaryString()** to display the results.
**Answer: [LongNotations.java](src/main/java/LongNotations.java)**
